Laundry Stats
=============

A program to poll the laundry services website at Tufts University
and collect information about the usage of washers/dryers.

### Why? ###
Not sure... I was bored and wanted to collect some data. Also,
reverse engineering the site, though simple, was fun to do.

### Potential Uses ###
To plot popular times for washing clothes and maybe predict when a
good time to do laundry is. Also get a peek into the schedules of
the students at a macro level. Et cetera...
